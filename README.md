# PlantWatering
This was a project that Miles Black and myself created for my IOT class.  The goal of this project was to create a self watering plant system that requires little to no human care.  This project was arduino based, and relied on a soil moisture sensor, water level sensor, 12v DC water pump, and an ESP8266. Data outputted by the sensors was uploaded to Google Spreadsheets via Temboo, and several functionalities were controlled via the Blynk.
